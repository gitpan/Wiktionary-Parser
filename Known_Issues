* Some less common languages that appear in Wiktionary don't map exactly to the names or codes 
  in Locale::Codes::Language.  For these I've tried to manually add mappings for various spelling
  variations of the same language.  

* In some cases where a language doesn't have an official language code I've tried to default to
  conventions used in Wiktionary.  Beyond that I've refered the the Linguist List for unofficial 
  language codes.

* Although the parser is successful at parsing the standard Wiktionary templates to extract translations,
  occasionally it'll fail to parse some entries due to typos or minor variations to the template that 
  someone added in.  I'll make any necessary additions to account for official Wiktionary templates, 
  and try to make sure that broken wiki syntax doesn't do Bad Things in this parser.
